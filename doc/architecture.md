# Sonata architecture specification

The Sonata architecture comprises a number of components:
- Physical board architecture:
  This is the board that hosts the FPGA (field programmable gate array), all other components, headers and interfaces.
- FPGA configuration architecture:
  It defines everything we are using a hardware description language for.
  This includes hardware IP blocks and bus architecture.
- Software architecture:
  This includes toolchain, operating system and applications.

Before we go into the architecture of the system, it is good to understand the use cases that we are envisioning, so that we can derive our architectural requirements from that.
